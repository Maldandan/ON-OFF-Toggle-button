# ON & OFF Toggle Button

Here, I created an ON & OFF Toggle Button with ARDUINO.
Transistor and Relay were used in this circuit, this will be handy in future robotic projects where we will need to turn the robot on and off.
Toggle buttons are useful since we can code our ARDUINO to do different tasks on click, and sleep or shut down on number of clicks, or sleep after delay for example!

# Motion Detecting Bulb

Here, I have used PIR Sensor ( passive infrared sensor) alongside Relay in the circuit. 
A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view.
As the PIR sensor detects  heat energy in the surrounding, the bulb will light up!

this will be useful if we were to turn on a machine or system only in case of someone was around or within range (in our case the robot). and otherwise, sleep or shutdown after some delay.
